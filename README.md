## üìÅ Project Structure

- `main.py` - Entry point with command-line argument parsing
- `config.py` - Configuration settings with defaults for paths and database
- `orchestrator.py` - Pipeline execution logic with Task class and SimpleScheduler
- `extractors/` - Modules for different data sources
- `transformers/` - Data transformation modules for sales calculations
- `validators/` - Data validation
- `loaders/` - Database and file export functionality
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control

## üìã Data Sources

- CSV: Order data, product catalogs, customer information
